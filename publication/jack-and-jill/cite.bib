	abstract = {Visuospatial working memory ({VSWM}) is essential to human cognitive abilities and is associated with important life outcomes such as academic performance. Recently, a number of reliable measures of {VSWM} have been developed to help understand psychological processes and for practical use in education. We sought to extend this work using Item Response Theory ({IRT}) and Computerised Adaptive Testing ({CAT}) frameworks to construct, calibrate and validate a new adaptive, computerised, and open-source {VSWM} test. We aimed to overcome the limitations of previous instruments and provide researchers with a valid and freely available {VSWM} measurement tool. The Jack and Jill ({JaJ}) {VSWM} task was constructed using explanatory item response modelling of data from a sample of the general adult population (Study 1, N = 244) in the {UK} and {US}. Subsequently, a static version of the task was tested for validity and reliability using a sample of adults from the {UK} and Australia (Study 2, N = 148) and a sample of Russian adolescents (Study 3, N = 263). Finally, the adaptive version of the {JaJ} task was implemented on the basis of the underlying {IRT} model and evaluated with another sample of Russian adolescents (Study 4, N = 239). {JaJ} showed sufficient internal consistency and concurrent validity as indicated by significant and substantial correlations with established measures of working memory, spatial ability, non-verbal intelligence, and academic achievement. The findings suggest that {JaJ} is an efficient and reliable measure of {VSWM} from adolescent to adult age.},
